# MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Classification
The MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset is a large database of handwritten digits. The dataset consists of 60,000 training and 10,000 test images, each of 28x28 grayscale pixels, representing digits from 0 to 9. 
The goal of this project is to build an automated model that can accurately classify these digits.
